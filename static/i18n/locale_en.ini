housing-cooperative.challenge.p1 = High mortgage annual percentage rate that can be raised at any time

housing-cooperative.proposal.header = General thoughts
housing-cooperative.proposal.p1 = An alternative mechanism for real estate acquisition is needed. The existence of such a public mechanism should serve as a motivation for commercial banks to reduce an effective APR to 1-2 %%. This mechanism should be sustainable, and work for decades.

housing-cooperative.goal.header = Project goal
housing-cooperative.goal.p1 = Foundation of a cooperative for the real estate acquisition. This cooperative will be with open accounting: all internal operations and documentation will be publicly available. Operational principles will be as transparent as possible. The cooperative functions should be automated as much as possible. We might not be able to implement it 100 percent right away but this is a goal to achieve.

housing-cooperative.rules.header = Cooperative operation principles
housing-cooperative.rules.p1 = We open a cooperative account and on this account we will accumulate money for the purchase of housing.
housing-cooperative.rules.p2 = Anyone can participate in the cooperative. The participant is determined with the real estate cost and the period for which he undertakes to pay off the debt. Further on, the participant contributes 1/3 of the cost to the cooperative account and joins the queue.

housing-cooperative.rules.p4 = Cooperative takes the ownership over the property. This stimulate the participant to repay his debt to the cooperative. The participant himself is an encumbrancer (a scheme reverse to a bank mortgage) and this prevents cooperative founders from selling acquired property and leave in an unknown direction.

housing-cooperative.overpayments.i2 = Documents fee - about 50 000 rubles. All document fees will be on you. An employee of the cooperative will have to come and settle the deal. In the beginning of our cooperative it might require a trip to another city, with the growth of our community, employees will appear in different cities. Also you can include in costs mandatory real estate insurance.
housing-cooperative.overpayments.i3 = Membership fees are 1000 rubles per month. Total for 10 years, the total fee paid is 120,000 rubles. Those funds are intended for support and development of the cooperative operations.

housing-cooperative.participants.header = Participant requirements
housing-cooperative.participants.i1 = We do not need to know your legal name. But since all documents on the cooperative will be in the public domain, your name will be exposed during documentation.
housing-cooperative.participants.i2 = We do not need personal income tax forms. We do not care where do you work and your role (banks might not give a mortgage to Sole Proprietors). But you must take a responsible approach to determining the value of the property you are purchasing. Your monthly payments should be reasonable for you.

housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p3 = If the property has not yet been purchased, then your losses will be 4 %% (two bank transfers).
housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p4 = If the property had already been acquired, then it will sold at market price, this amount repays the debt to the cooperative, and the rest is returned to the former participant. In this case a participant can earn or lose depending on the housing market situation.

housing-cooperative.defaulter.header = Non payers
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p1 = We’re trying to create a transparent and beneficial scheme for everyone. Honest participation in our scheme is advantageous and overpayment is quite small when compared to others.
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p2 = If a participant agrees to a peaceful default adjustment then the property is sold at market value, this debt is repaid to the cooperative, and the rest is returned to the former participant. In this case a participant can both earn or lose depending onn the housing market situation.
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p3 = If a participant does not agree to a peaceful default adjustment then the proceeding goes through the court. Despite the fact that it is long and painful, we have no other way out.

housing-cooperative.about-us.header = We are a pyramid
housing-cooperative.about-us.p1 = Pyramid principle lies behind our cooperative's business. Housing is acquired because of new members are coming in. We proceed from the fact that the pyramid is not always bad it all depends on the founders will and how honest their intentions are. The main thing is that the pyramid is stable.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p2 = Main assets of our cooperative are acquired real estate and funds on the cooperative account. If we sell all the property we own we will get the amount (except for the transfer fees) funded by our members. In this case, we can spread out and everyone will get their own. Only thing we’ll not be able to refund is membership fee since those funds already spent on the cooperative operation and development.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p3 = Guarantees that we can offer you: our accounting book will be fully open - blockchain technology used for it. We will accept cadrd transfers from Visa / MasterCard which allow you to issue a chargeback procedure in case you consider the work of our cooperative as fraud.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p4 = At this moment our project does not have an investor and it is unlikely that it will come in. Investments for zero or negative percent are not attractive. Another projects, such as: "Public Pension Fund", "Community of Soviet People" could become investors in our cooperative. But for now the money we have will only be the money of our participants.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p5 = This project in nature is a queue, and you have to wait for the moment of your turn. Everything will depend on the number of participants in our community.
