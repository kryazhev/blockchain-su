housing-cooperative.challenge.header=Challenge
housing-cooperative.challenge.p1=High mortgage annual percentage rate that can be raised at any time

housing-cooperative.proposal.header=General thoughts
housing-cooperative.proposal.p1=An alternative mechanism for real estate acquisition is needed. The existence of such a public mechanism should serve as a motivation for commercial banks to reduce an effective APR to 1-2 %%. This mechanism should be sustainable, and work for decades.

housing-cooperative.goal.header=Project goal
housing-cooperative.goal.p1=Foundation of a cooperative for the real estate acquisition. This cooperative will be with open accounting: all internal operations and documentation will be publicly available. Operational principles will be as transparent as possible. The cooperative functions should be automated as much as possible. We might not be able to implement it 100 percent right away but this is a goal to achieve.

housing-cooperative.rules.header=Cooperative operation principles
housing-cooperative.rules.p1=We open a cooperative account and on this account we will accumulate money for the purchase of housing.
housing-cooperative.rules.p2=Anyone can participate in the cooperative. The participant is determined with the real estate cost and the period for which he undertakes to pay off the debt. Further on, the participant contributes 1/3 of the cost to the cooperative account and joins the queue.
housing-cooperative.rules.p3=When you accumulate the required amount on the account, the acquires a real estate to the first participant in the queue. After that, the participant of the cooperative begins to repay its debts on a monthly basis.
housing-cooperative.rules.p4=Cooperative takes the ownership over the property. This stimulate the participant to repay his debt to the cooperative. The participant himself is an encumbrancer (a scheme reverse to a bank mortgage) and this prevents cooperative founders from selling acquired property and leave in an unknown direction.
housing-cooperative.rules.p5=When participant repays his debt to the cooperative he becomes a property legal owner and it ends participation in the cooperative.
housing-cooperative.rules.p6=Each participant makes monthly cooperative contributions of 1000 rubles. Co-op member starts to pay contribution fee since the moment he acquires a housing. Member stop paying fees when he repays a debt to the cooperative.

housing-cooperative.overpayments.header=Loan cost
housing-cooperative.overpayments.i1=Bank transfer fee is 2 %%. Perhaps we’ll find a way to transfer without fees, or to reduce it.
housing-cooperative.overpayments.i2=Documents fee - about 50 000 rubles. All document fees will be on you. An employee of the cooperative will have to come and settle the deal. In the beginning of our cooperative it might require a trip to another city, with the growth of our community, employees will appear in different cities. Also you can include in costs mandatory real estate insurance.
housing-cooperative.overpayments.i3=Membership fees are 1000 rubles per month. Total for 10 years, the total fee paid is 120,000 rubles. Those funds are intended for support and development of the cooperative operations.

housing-cooperative.participants.header=Participant requirements
housing-cooperative.participants.i1=We do not need to know your legal name. But since all documents on the cooperative will be in the public domain, your name will be exposed during documentation.
housing-cooperative.participants.i2=We do not need personal income tax forms. We do not care where do you work and your role (banks might not give a mortgage to Sole Proprietors). But you must take a responsible approach to determining the value of the property you are purchasing. Your monthly payments should be reasonable for you.
housing-cooperative.participants.i3=We do not care about your citizenship to participate in the cooperative. But you have to be a citizen at the time when you pay off in order for take real estate ownership.

housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.header=Withdrawal from the cooperative
housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p1=You can apply to full or partial funds withdraw from the cooperative at any time.
housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p2=Withdraw application is also a queue but the difference is they have a higher priority. When cooperative account accumulates necessary amount this application will be processed in the order of the queue.
housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p3=If the property has not yet been purchased, then your losses will be 4 %% (two bank transfers).
housing-cooperative.withdraw-funds.p4=If the property had already been acquired, then it will sold at market price, this amount repays the debt to the cooperative, and the rest is returned to the former participant. In this case a participant can earn or lose depending on the housing market situation.

housing-cooperative.defaulter.header=Non payers
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p1=We’re trying to create a transparent and beneficial scheme for everyone. Honest participation in our scheme is advantageous and overpayment is quite small when compared to others.
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p2=If a participant agrees to a peaceful default adjustment then the property is sold at market value, this debt is repaid to the cooperative, and the rest is returned to the former participant. In this case a participant can both earn or lose depending on the housing market situation.
housing-cooperative.defaulter.p3=If a participant does not agree to a peaceful default adjustment then the proceeding goes through the court. Despite the fact that it is long and painful, we have no other way out.

housing-cooperative.about-us.header=We are a pyramid
housing-cooperative.about-us.p1=Pyramid principle lies behind our cooperative's business. Housing is acquired because of new members are coming in. We proceed from the fact that the pyramid is not always bad it all depends on the founders will and how honest their intentions are. The main thing is that the pyramid is stable.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p2=Main assets of our cooperative are acquired real estate and funds on the cooperative account. If we sell all the property we own we will get the amount (except for the transfer fees) funded by our members. In this case, we can spread out and everyone will get their own. Only thing we’ll not be able to refund is membership fee since those funds already spent on the cooperative operation and development.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p3=Guarantees that we can offer you: our accounting book will be fully open - blockchain technology used for it. We will accept card transfers from Visa / MasterCard which allow you to issue a chargeback procedure in case you consider the work of our cooperative as fraud.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p4=At this moment our project does not have an investor and it is unlikely that it will come in. Investments for zero or negative percent are not attractive. Another projects, such as: "Public Pension Fund", "Community of Soviet People" could become investors in our cooperative. But for now the money we have will only be the money of our participants.
housing-cooperative.about-us.p5=This project in nature is a queue, and you have to wait for the moment of your turn. Everything will depend on the number of participants in our community.

ussr-2.0.challenge.header=Challenge
ussr-2.0.challenge.p1=It is obvious that no investors “from the west” will ever come to make us happy.

ussr-2.0.proposal.header=General thoughts
ussr-2.0.proposal.p1=Most of the socialist countries fell down by same scenario: public property privatization, tax cuts, the destruction of the social state.
ussr-2.0.proposal.p2=No one but ourselves will change our life to better. Everything that happens in our country is our own responsibility.
ussr-2.0.proposal.p3=A fair society, social security, worry free retirement - are goals we need to achieve. And today’s world technologies allow the community to take care of those problems.
ussr-2.0.proposal.p4=The project goal is to start an investment fund that would select and finance socially important projects.

ussr-2.0.money.header=About the money
ussr-2.0.money.p1=All money is a matter of belief. Few centuries ago people believed that gold is an equivalent of value, today they believe that special ”paper" is such value equivalent. And in a past decade some people who believe that "nothing" (crypto-currencies) also have value began to appear.
ussr-2.0.money.p2=There are crypto-anarchists who think that crypto-currencies can become a non-government money and existence of crypto-currencies will allow society to take money issue and flow under public control. But if you want to win you have be smarter than your opponent. In modern society questions about what the money really is and how to take them under public control are not even discussed.
ussr-2.0.money.p3=Society does not need money itself, instead the real needs are goods and services created as a result of labor. In order for society to break free the very faith in money and its necessity should be destroyed. But bursting this bubble and getting an anarchy is not the goal, instead we need to blow off this bubble with no upheaval in society.

ussr-2.0.goal.header=Purpose of the project
ussr-2.0.goal.p1=The ultimate goal of this project is to build a society of free people. A free man is one who is master of his own and no other man exploits him or his labor. It is crucial to create a national economy that would ensure that every person could be supplied with everything necessary for a worthy life.
ussr-2.0.goal.p2=A great capitalist country goal is to take the first place in the list of countries in terms of GDP. A great socialist country goal is to take the last place on this list (with a value of zero US dollars).
ussr-2.0.goal.p3=This does not mean that we have to ruin all the industry and stop to produce anything, on the contrary, we make production so effective that the cost of products became zero.
ussr-2.0.goal.p4=Based on the fact that all resources belong to the people, there are two small problems humanity has to deal with: artificial intelligence and free energy. After that it will became realistic to build production chains of any complexity at zero cost price.
ussr-2.0.goal.p5=Certainly, these "simple" tasks will not be solved in the nearest future. But why do not we start moving in this direction?

ussr-2.0.rules.header=Fund rules and principles
ussr-2.0.rules.p1=The fund is non profit the goal is implementation of interesting projects. Anyone can become a member of our foundation. Then we start looking for interesting ideas. Anyone can contribute an idea and get support from the participants of our fund in the form of financing. Ownership type of a business does not matter. Projects can even have negative profit margin from finance point of view.
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i1=Foundation of a federal construction company (charges at prime-cost level)
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i2=Foundation of the federal retail network (charges at prime-cost level)
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i3=Construction of a secure shopping complex (with a minimum fee for tenants)
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i4=Construction of a new bridge
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i5=Construction of a new cosmodrome
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i6=Erection of the monument to V Churkin
ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i7=Conducting children's cycling competitions in

ussr-2.0.rules.p1.i7.badge=Your City

ussr-2.0.management.header=Management
ussr-2.0.management.p1=To implement projects we need managers. People make decisions having their own interests in mind. Fighting corruption is worthless, it is impossible to fight human nature.
ussr-2.0.management.p2=Soviet leadership was a good example of a top-ranked managers who did not think just about their own well-being but about something more, despite of how much negativity and criticism was about it. That type of leaders is what we need to find denote and support.

pension-fund.challenge.header=Challenge
pension-fund.challenge.p1=The Social Security Retirement Age Increases for Russian citizens in nearest future

pension-fund.proposal.header=General reasoning
pension-fund.proposal.p1=There is a need for alternative ideas for pension reform. There is no magic bullet that will will resolve issues an will make everyone happy. But there is a proposal for those who want to manage their own lives: Let's unite and create our own pension fund and take over the management ourselves. And we will define the rules, according to which out fund will operate:
pension-fund.proposal.p1.i1=everyone manages his own funds by himself
pension-fund.proposal.p1.i2=there are several investment options (for the most desperate - we can even include crypto-currency)
pension-fund.proposal.p1.i3=there is an opportunity to withdraw the savings (perhaps this is contrary to the law, but the laws vary ...)
pension-fund.proposal.p1.i4=any other rule that we will come up with in future
pension-fund.proposal.p1.i4.badge=New
pension-fund.proposal.p2=Unfortunately, such a fund also has its shortcomings. For example: due to the lack of staff customer service will be limited. Although in the modern days of digital technologies the service can be automated, we just have to work on it.

municipal-services.challenge.header=Challenge
municipal-services.challenge.p1=Housing services and management are ones of the hottest and hardest topics for our society.

municipal-services.proposal.header=General reasoning
municipal-services.proposal.p1=Blockchain technology has a great potential to revolutionize those services. Management system with a fully open accounting and transparent voting system would bring a service quality to a new heights.
municipal-services.proposal.p2=As a starting point - create a platform aimed to collect interesting ideas and start a public discussions. Further implementation of the best ones should follow.

bank.challenge.header=Challenge
bank.challenge.p1=Today banks operations are non-transparent. Occasionally bank became a bankrupt that is followed by problems for clients. Money transfer fees are usually high. Software capabilities (API) for account management are absent.

bank.proposal.header=General reasoning
bank.proposal.p1=A public bank foundation will enable people to set the rules of the game by themselves. Certainly traditional banks will stay in place since full customer service is necessary and till the day a bigger number of blockchain communities a full-fledged bank will be required.
bank.proposal.p2=Standard bank operations should be available: account refill, withdrawal, interbank transfers. All these operations must be performed quickly, with no fees (or with a minimal fees), with an option to cancel the operation.
bank.proposal.p3=Blockchain banks could become fully open banks, or at least be much more transparent. Such banks can guarantee to clients that their funds will not be lost. They should become separate entities, not just an new division of any closed bank, transparency could not be achieved when only a small part of the operations will be revealed.
bank.proposal.p4=Bank secrecy act and transparency are conflicting and here is a big question: what information about the account activities should be available to everyone and what should be private and encrypted. However encryption does not guarantee that the data will not be eventually decoded.
bank.proposal.p5=A lot of questions should be answered prior to creation of such public banks. Initial "pilot" implementations could have a number of vulnerabilities and problems but first steps in this direction must be made. Best case scenario is to implement such public banks within the central banks because of this could reduce the back pressure of commercial banks and also serve as an incentive for others to integrate with it.

[about-us]
about-me.photo=My Photo

about-me.header=About me
about-me.p1=My name is Kryazhev Vasily, was born in 1980 in the territory of Kazakhstan. In 2003 he graduated from the Computer Science Faculty of Tomsk State University. Since then, I have been working as a software engineer for 15 years.

genesis.header=The origin of the idea of the project
genesis.p1=For a last few years I was working on the project "Electronic Invoices" (for the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan). I was asked to take a closer look at the blockchain technology and analyze if it fits it in one of our projects. Even though this technology is not suitable for us but I was amazed by what I have learned. At the same time crypto-currency hype was on it’s peak and the same for other blockchain related projects. It is unbelievable how much time and effort was spent on all types of fraud.
genesis.p2=The second milestone for the continuation of this project was a meeting with a housing cooperative employee. I realized that I can implement it by myself after I listened of what he was saying. And even more, I can automate processes even further which make them more transparent and reduce the cost for co-op participants to a minimum.
genesis.p3=This site is my attempt to create a public good project based on the blockchain.

goal.header=The ultimate goal is Utopia
goal.p1=I'm just a Soviet man and probably my generation is the last from the Soviets. I think the USSR collapse was the end of the greatest project in the history of mankind. We are all adults, our views are very different.
goal.p2=This project was initiated to find adherent people and to revive the red project. If you believe that there should be free medicine free housing and free education for everyone, ‘Land to the peasants! Factories to the workers! We're the same blood!’ - let us unite and without revolutions and other great shocks of affairs, prove that building a fair society is possible.
goal.p3=It does not matter whether the capitalists (Zionists, Masons, Reptiloids, Anunaki, masochists, world government) or their henchmen will resist. We are not going to fight the rich people, our goal is to fight poverty.
goal.p4=Our goal is to build a great country based on peace, love and creation. Goals should be high and ”cosmic" even if just a few small steps will be made to achieve those goals the life will worth it.

conclusion.header=Conclusion
conclusion.p1=It is very difficult to express your ideas and thoughts, there is a fear of public condemnation and ridicule. I don’t want to offend or criticize anyone in any scenario.
conclusion.p2=Technology development has reached an incredible level and the information exchange speed is simply enormous. Direct communication with anywhere in world has become possible. All this leads to the fact that agents in the middle are not needed.
conclusion.p3=That is for sure new sites and platforms providing all necessary information and problem solving services without intermediaries will begin to appear. The only matter is to implement it..
